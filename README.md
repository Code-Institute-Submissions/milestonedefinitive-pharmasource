PHARMASOURCE,

-PROJECT OVERVIEW/SALES PICH
*WELCOME TO PHARMASOURCE*! PRECISION, QUALITY & CONSISTENCY;

HERE AT PHARMASOURCE WE BELIEVE IN OFFEREING PHARMA GRADE COMPOUNDS FORMULATED AND MANUFACTURED UNDER STRICT QUALITY CONTROLS TO UP AND COMING ATHLETES, SEASONED VETERANS AND MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. 
DID YOU KNOW THAT LOW TEST LEVELS ARE ASOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE CARDIOVASCULAR DESEASES?
WETHER YOU’RE AT A STAGE IN LIFE WHERE YOUR NATURAL TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE LOW, AN UP AND COMING POWERLIFTER, CYCLIST, BASEBALL PLAYER, BODYBUILDER ETC, OUR PURPOSE IS TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.

-UX
PHARMASOURCE. COM IS STILL VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS REGARDING USER EXPERIENCE, BUT FROM THE GETGO ITS PARAMOUNT THAT IT SCALES TO SMALLER DEVICES ADEQUATLEY. THE MAIN DEMOGRAPHIC ARE GYM GOERS THAT WANT TO BUY PED’S. IT INTENDS TO SET CLEAR RULES ON HOW FAST GOODS ARE DELIVERD AFTER PAYMENT AND HOW FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS ARE. IT WOULD BE FUN DOWN THE LINE TO INTEGRATE A SEARCH FOR PRODUCT FUNCTION, AN ABILITY TO SORT PRODUCTS BY PRICE ETC, BASICALLY AN INTERACTIVE BACK END AS WELL AS A MUCH-IMPROVED FRONT END. 

AS FOR WIRE FRAMES ETC, I TOOK EXAMPLE OF MANY PAGES HAVING A SEMI CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT I WANTED BUT THEN ENDED UP WITH A TRIAL AND ERROR APPROACH TO SEE WHAT LOOKED THE BEST TO MY VERY NOVICE EYES.  I USED ELEMENTS OF THE WHISKEY DROP PAGE AND THE LOVE RUNNING PAGE (CODE INSTITUTE PROJECTS) AS WELL AS TRYING OUT DIFFERENT BOOTSRAP ELEMENTS TO SEE HOW THEY LOOKED.

-FEATURES 

AGAIN, THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! BUT LET’S GO OVER THE FEATURES THAT ARE PRESENT AT THIS EARLY STAGE,

*THE NAVBAR CONTAINS THE PHARMASOURCE LOGO, AND THE PRODUCT SECTIONS, ORALS (TAKES USERS TO THE SECTION OF ORALLY ADDMINISTERED GOODS), INJECTIBLES (USERS ARE GUIDED TO THE INJECTABLE GOODS SECTION), AN ABOUT SECTION (WHAT AND WHO ARE BEHIND PHARMASOURCE)
*THERES A SMALL CALLOUT BANNER WHERE YOU CAN QUICKLY DOWNLOAD THE HOLE PRICELIST IN PDF FORMAT. 
*WHAT MOSTLY CATCHES OUR EYES HERE IS THE CALLOUT SECTION WHERE YOU SEE A DOCTORS HANDS HANDING OVER PRESCRIPRION MEDICATION. THERES A BUTTON HERE THAT TAKES US TO OUR NEW ORALS SECTION.
*INMEDIATLY AFTER THIS WE HAVE A SECTION WHERE WE OFFER REASURING POLICIES TO CUSTOMMERS REGARDING HOW SOON THEY WILL RECEIVE TRACKING NUMBERS ON THEIR ORDERS ETC.
*THERES THEN A CODE-INSTITUTE CALLED ETHOS SECTION, HERE WE TALK ABOUT WHY TRUSTING US WITH PHARMA GRADE GOODS IS A GOOD IDEA.
